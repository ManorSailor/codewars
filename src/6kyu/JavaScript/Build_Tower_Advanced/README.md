### Description

Build Tower Advanced
---

Build Tower by the following given arguments:<br>
* __number of floors__ (integer and always greater than 0)<br>
* __block size__ (width, height) (integer pair and always greater than (0, 0))

***
Tower block unit is represented as `*`. Tower blocks of block size (2, 1) and (2, 3) would look like respectively:
```
  **
```
```
  **
  **
  **
```
***
for example, a tower of 3 floors with block size = (2, 3) looks like below
```
[
      **    ,
      **    ,
      **    ,
    ******  ,
    ******  ,
    ******  ,
  **********,
  **********,
  **********
]
```
and a tower of 6 floors with block size = (2, 1) looks like below
```
[
            **          , 
          ******        , 
        **********      , 
      **************    , 
    ******************  , 
  **********************
]
```
***

Dont return a whole string containing line-endings but a list/array/vector of strings instead!

This kata might looks like a __5.5kyu__ one. So challenge yourself!

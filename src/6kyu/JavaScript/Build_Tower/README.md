### Description

Build Tower

Build a pyramid-shaped tower given a positive integer `number of floors`. A tower block is represented with `*` character.

For example, a tower with `3` floors looks like this:

```
[
    *  ,
   *** , 
  *****
]
```

And a tower with `6` floors looks like this:

```
[
       *     , 
      ***    , 
     *****   , 
    *******  , 
   ********* , 
  ***********
]
```

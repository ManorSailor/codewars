## [Count characters in your string](https://www.codewars.com/kata/52efefcbcdf57161d4000091)
---
### Description

The main idea is to count all the occurring characters in a string. If you have a string like `aba`, then the result should be `{a: 2, b: 1}`.

What if the string is empty? Then the result should be empty object literal, `{}`.

### Description

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string This website is for losers LOL! would become Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!.

Note: for this kata `y` isnt considered a vowel.

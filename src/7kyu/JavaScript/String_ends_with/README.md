### Takeaways
- Breaking the problem down on a paper is recommended
- Some methods optional arguments can be helpful
- Don't make life harder than it already is, use appropriate methods
- Subtracting `x.length` from `y.length` will give the index number which is exactly the size of `x.length`
    - Seems obvious, but Its better to write down obvious things first, especially while programming.

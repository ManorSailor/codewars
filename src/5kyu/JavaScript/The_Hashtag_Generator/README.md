### Description

The marketing team is spending way too much time typing in hashtags.   
Lets help them with our own Hashtag Generator!

Heres the deal:

- It must start with a hashtag (`#`).
- All words must have their first letter capitalized.
- If the final result is longer than 140 chars it must return `false`.
- If the input or the result is an empty string it must return `false`.


## Examples

```
 Hello there thanks for trying my Kata  =>  #HelloThereThanksForTryingMyKata
    Hello     World                     =>  #HelloWorld
                                        =>  false
```
